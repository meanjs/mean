  <h1>Deploying To Cloud Foundry</h1>
  <p>
    <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> is an open source platform-as-a-service (PaaS).
    The MEAN.JS boilerplate can easily be deployed to any Cloud Foundry instance.
    The easiest way to deploy MEAN.JS to Cloud Foundry is to use a public hosted Cloud Foundry instance.
    The two most popular instances are <a href="https://run.pivotal.io/" target="_blank">Pivotal Web Services</a>
    and <a href="http://bluemix.net" target="_blank">IBM Bluemix</a>. Both provide free trials
    and support pay-as-you-go models for hosting applications in the cloud. After you have an account
    on either Pivotal Web Services or IBM Bluemix follow the below steps to deploy MEAN.JS
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Install the
    <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a>command line tools.</li>
    <li>You need to log into Cloud Foundry from the Cloud Foundry command line.
      <ul>
        <li>If you are using Pivotal Web Services run <pre>$ cf login -a api.run.pivotal.io</pre></li>
        <li>If you are using IBM Bluemix run <pre>$ cf login -a api.ng.bluemix.net</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Create a Mongo DB service, IBM Bluemix and Pivotal Web Services offer a free MongoLabs service.
      <ul>
        <li><pre>$ cf create-service mongolab sandbox mean-mongo</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Clone the GitHub repo for MEAN.JS if you have not already done so
      <ul>
        <li><pre>$ git clone https://github.com/meanjs/mean.git &amp;&amp; cd mean</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Run NPM install
      <ul>
        <li><pre>$ npm install</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Run the Grunt Build task to build the optimized JavaScript and CSS files
      <ul>
        <li><pre>$ grunt build</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Once within the root directory of the MEAN.js project, deploy MEAN.JS to Cloud Foundry
      <ul>
        <li><pre>$ cf push</pre></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After `cf push` completes you will see the URL to your running MEANJS application (your URL will be different).
  </p>
  <pre>
    requested state: started
    instances: 1/1
    usage: 128M x 1 instances
    urls: mean-humbler-frappa.mybluemix.net
  </pre>
  <p>Open your browser and go to that URL and your should see your MEAN.JS app running!</p>

  <h2>Configuring Social Services</h2>
  <p>
    MEAN.JS allows you to login via a number of social services. In other deployments of MEAN.JS
    you need to configure environment variables with the various keys and secrets to enable these
    social services. While this is possible in Cloud Foundry, it is not the preferred method. Credentials
    like this are usually surfaced through services an application can bind to. For this reason, when you
    deploy MEAN.JS to Cloud Foundry you must configure and bind services to your application in order to
    login with the various social services. To do this we will use what is called user provided services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once your application is deployed to Cloud Foundry run the following command for the social services
    you would like to use. Make sure you insert the correct credentials for the service.
  </p>
  <h3>Facebook</h3>
  <pre>
    $ cf cups mean-facebook -p '{"id":"facebookId","secret":"facebookSecret"}'
    $ cf bind-service mean mean-facebook
  </pre>
  <h3>Twitter</h3>
  <pre>
    $ cf cups mean-twitter -p '{"key":"twitterKey","secret":"twitterSecret"}'
    $ cf bind-service mean mean-twitter
  </pre>
  <h3>Google</h3>
  <pre>
    $ cf cups mean-google -p '{"id":"googleId","secret":"googleSecret"}'
    $ cf bind-service mean mean-google
  </pre>
  <h3>LinkedIn</h3>
  <pre>
    $ cf cups mean-linkedin -p '{"id":"linkedinId","secret":"linkedinSecret"}'
    $ cf bind-service mean mean-linkedin
  </pre>
  <h3>GitHub</h3>
  <pre>
    $ cf cups mean-github -p '{"id":"githubId","secret":"githubSecret"}'
    $ cf bind-service mean mean-github
  </pre>
  <h3>Email</h3>
  <pre>
    $ cf cups mean-mail -p '{"from":"fromEmail","service":"emailService","username":"emailServiceUsername",
    "password":"emailServicePassword"}'
    $ cf bind-service mean mean-mail
  </pre>
  <p>
    After you have bound the services your want to your MEAN.JS application run
    <pre>$ cf restage mean</pre> to restage your application and your social services should now work.

  <h2>Cloud Foundry Troubleshooting</h2>
  <h3>Every time I deploy my application to Cloud Foundry a new route gets added, why?
      How do I fix this?</h3>
  <p>
    No two apps deployed to a Cloud Foundry instance can have the same URL or route bound to it.
    To avoid failures during deployment where two people try to deploy MEANJS to the same Cloud Foundry instance
    using the same URL, the `manifest.yml` file in the root directory of MEANJS
    contains a host property specifying that Cloud Foundry assign a random URL to your application.
    This URL will begin with the prefix 'mean-' and end with a random word.  If you perform multiple
    `cf push` commands Cloud Foundry will bind a new random URL or route to your application each time.
    This means you end up with multiple URLs pointing to the same application instance.  While this does not hurt
    your application it is generally not necessary.  You can fix this by changing the host property in
    your `manifest.yml` file to remove the `${random-word}` string from it.  However note that if your
    host name is not unique, your deployment will fail.  If it does fail try changing the host property to
    something else.
