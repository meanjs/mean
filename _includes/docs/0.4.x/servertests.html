  <h1>Server Tests</h1>
</section>
<section>
  <p>
    We use <a target="_blank" href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a> to test the server side logic. Mocha tests are asynchronous, easy to maintain, and uses a readable <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">BDD</a> syntax.
  </p>
  <h4>Assertions</h4>
  <p>
    Mocha needs an external assertion library to predicate the result of each test, in this case <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js">Should.js</a> is being used. Should is an expressive library aiming to simplify tests and be readable. It extends the Object.prototype with a single non-enumerable getter that allows you to express how that object should behave.
  </p>
  <h4>Test Files</h4>
  <p>
    Each entity have its own test file located inside their respective module server tests folder. Ex.: <b>modules/core/tests/server</b>
  </p>
  <h4>Writing Tests</h4>
  <p>
    There are a few common steps we use to test an entity:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In the <b>beforeEach</b> or <b>before</b> functions take care of prerequisites and create the objects you are about to use in your tests.
    </li>
    <li>
      For each test start with a <b>describe</b> function to indicate which method is being tested.
    </li>
    <li>
      Next, add your scenario tests using the <b>it</b> function.
    </li>
    <li>
      In the <b>it</b> function run the tests functionality and use should to assert what the end result should be.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally use <b>after</b> or <b>afterEach</b> functions to finalize your tests and clear the test database.
    </li>
  </ol>
